            "Crocodiles have a powerful bite, with a force of up to 3,700 pounds per square inch.",
            "Unlike most reptiles, crocodiles have a four-chambered heart, similar to birds and mammals.",
            "Crocodiles can hold their breath underwater for up to an hour.",
            "They have a special valve in their throat that allows them to open their mouths underwater without drowning.",
            "Crocodiles are excellent swimmers and can reach speeds of up to 20 miles per hour in the water.",
            "They can also run on land, reaching speeds of up to 11 miles per hour for short distances.",
            "Crocodiles have a lifespan of 70 to 100 years in the wild.",
            "They have a unique way of cooling down by opening their mouths, which is known as 'mouth gaping'.",
            "Crocodiles are carnivorous and have a diet that includes fish, birds, mammals, and occasionally other reptiles.",
            "They have a highly developed sense of smell, which helps them locate prey.",
            "Crocodiles communicate with each other through vocalizations, including growls, hisses, and roars.",
            "The temperature of the nest determines the sex of the hatchlings: warmer temperatures produce males, while cooler temperatures produce females.",
